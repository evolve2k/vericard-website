Vericard is a physical age verification card that can be purchased from retailers and can then be used to enable what we believe to be the most private form of digital age verification. The core of our offering is to address the privacy concerns by leaning on the existing well established protocols of tried-and-true in-person age id through traditional in person retail channels and make this product available for sale for a few dollars, over the counter.

We actively supply through retailers and locations that already provide age restricted products, drawing on the existing retail systems, protocols and experience of both customers and staff at these retail locations.

To retail our products its currently a requirement that you already sell some form of age restricted product and have existing protocols in place with your staff around securely storing age restricted products where customers cannot access them and having age checking protocols in place and in active use. 

We expect this should be no issue for retailers who currently provide products like: alchohol, cigarettes, spray cans, SIM cards, adult restricted media (books, games etc.).
